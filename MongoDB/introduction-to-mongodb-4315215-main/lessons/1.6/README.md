# Using the MongoDB Database Tools

The MongoDB Database Tools is a set of command line programs you can use to interact and work with MongoDB. In this lesson we'll review installing the tools, what each one does and how to use a couple we use within the course.

Make sure you install `mongoimport` as well as `mongofiles` you will need them in this course!
